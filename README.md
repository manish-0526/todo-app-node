# TODO App

## Documentation

TODO application is a web based app that allows user to create and manage list of tasks.

At the core of the application is Node.js, a robust and versatile JavaScript runtime. Node.js allows us to build a fast, scalable server-side environment, ensuring app can handle numerous tasks and users simultaneously with high performance.

Express.js is used for the efficient handling of HTTP requests and routing, making the app both powerful and flexible.

For the front end, EJS is used. EJS is a templating engine that allows us to generate HTML markup with plain JavaScript. EJS makes it easy to create dynamic, reusable components and deliver a seamless user experience by rendering server-side content efficiently.

Data layer is powered by MongoDB, a leading NoSQL database. MongoDB offers a flexible schema design and high performance for handling large volumes of data, ensuring that your tasks are stored securely and retrieved quickly.
